After changing some code i wanted to deploy app. The result was "published" but I couldn't see the new app. It only worked after I changed the default branch in gitHub pages to master and then back to gh-pages

new icons so we have a consistent look
mobile menu -> only icon 'open menu', on click 'open menu' not shown but the mobile menu

In order to use a react app on github we have to prepare the whole thing a little bit. I followed this procedure:
1. Create an empty repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new React app on your computer with 
    $ create-react-app your_app_name
3. Install the gh-pages package as a "dev-dependency" of the app with 
    $ cd your_app_name
    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev
4. Add some properties to the app's package.json file (this got created as you create the react app)

in the first line add: 
//...
"homepage": "http://your_gitname.github.io/your_app_name"

in the scripts lines (just look below)
"scripts": {
  //...
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

5. Create a git repository in the app's folder with
$ git init

6. Add the GitHub repository as a "remote" in your local git repository with
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_gitname/your_app_name.git

7. Generate a production build of your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages with
$ npm run deploy

As I know, you have to do this everytime you change your code. The repository has two branches, master and gh-pages. When you push, you push to master,
gh-pages doesn't get automatically the new code (at least not yet). deploying means you create a new verion of the react app and publish it on github 
in branch 'gh-pages'

8. Optionally, commit your source code to the "master" branch and push your commit to GitHub with
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "your comment"
$ git push origin master

Here is the link to the tutorial I followed: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages
Here an other link to a similar one: https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f
And an other one for doing rather manually: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/deploying-your-react-website-to-github-pages-ac0e24601bdf

Here if you created the wrong remote in number '6':

git remote - v
Will display origin and the wrong remote url
To delete it
git remote rm origin
Then check again
git remote - v
Will display nothing time to add the right one
